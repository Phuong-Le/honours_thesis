    \caption{\textbf{Illustration of jackknife analysis}. For a hypothetical cancer with 4 donors, the original odds ratio $OR$ is computed. Donor 1 is then omitted and a new odds ratio $OR_1$ is recomputed. The same is applied to every other donor. The end result is a set of odds ratio statistics $\{OR_1, \ldots, OR_4\}$ that is used to estimate the possible range of the true $OR$ statistic}
