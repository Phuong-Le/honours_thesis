    \caption{\textbf{SCE classifiers using the 3-mer context  were the most accurate}. For each combination of representation/metric, I iterated the training procedures of the KNN classifier 10 times using Jensen-Shannon distance. The performance of the classifier was computed based on a previously held out test data set and reported as confusion matrices and $F1$'s. The y-axis is the means of $F1$ for 1-mer, 3-mer \& 5-mer and asymmetry, semi-symmetry \& full-symmetry; the error bars are the standard errors for the iterated $F1$â€™s. The corresponding confusion matrices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:apdx_ml_sce}.}
