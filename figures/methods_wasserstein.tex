    \caption{\textbf{Schematic diagram for Euclidean and Wasserstein distance between two vectors.} Euclidean is the point-wise difference between the same location on vectors A and B, and is strictly in the vertical direction. Wasserstein is takes into account both the vertical and horizontal directions; it is intuitively the minimal amount of work required to transport mass from A to B.}
