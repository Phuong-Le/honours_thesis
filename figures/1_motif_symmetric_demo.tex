    \caption{\textbf{It is common practice to assume strand symmetry when analysing mutations.} In this example, AGC[G$\rightarrow$A]GAT is assumed to occur whenever there is a ATC[C$\rightarrow$G]GCT mutation on the reverse complementary strand. However, observations supporting strand asymmetry have been reported. This project explores the effect of the strand symmetric \textit{v.s.} strand asymmetric assumption.}
