    \caption{\textbf{Chromatin structure is not discriminative of cancers.} This figure shows an experiment where $OR$'s were calculated by cross-matching DHS data with mutation data of different cancers. The x-axis is the distribution of $OR$ with mislabelled DHS data, the y-axis is the cancers whose mutation data was used, with the purple dot indicating when DHS data of the true cancer was used.}
