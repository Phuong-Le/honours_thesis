    \caption{\textbf{Dissecting 5-mer into multiple submotifs can potentially improve prediction accuracy compared to whole 5-mer}. For each combination of representation, I iterated the training procedures 10 times. The y-axis is the means of $F1$ for all representations/measures, the error bars are the standard errors for the iterated $F1$'s.}
