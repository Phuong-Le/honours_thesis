    \caption{\textbf{SCE was the stronger determinant of cancer prediction}. I combined GLE and SCE using two approaches: the conventional approach (binned GLE and semi-symmetric SCE) and the proposed approach (smoothed GLE and asymmetric SCE). The x-axis is the weight given to GLE $g$, the weight given to SCE is accordingly $1-g$. For each weight combination, I iterated the training procedures 10 times. The y-axis is the means of $F1$ for all representations/measures, the error bars are the standard errors for the iterated $F1$'s}
