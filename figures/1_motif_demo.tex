    \caption{\textbf{Mutations are closely linked with the bases next to them}. The schematic diagram depicts hypothetical scenarios where a deaminase protein, which converts methylated C into T, interacts with DNA. Certain sequence contexts make the conversion more feasible than others. While many publications focus on the 3-mer context of mutations, which includes the base change and two bases immediately next to it, evidence shows that bases outside the 3-mer could still be influential. Part of this project seeks to explore the information content available in larger sequence contexts than 3-mers.}
