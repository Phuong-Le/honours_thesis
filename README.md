# honours_thesis

This repository is my Honours thesis at the Research school of Biology, the Australian National University, 2021. \
For those preparing to write a thesis, hopefully you can find some helpful Latex code for your own document. \
People interested in bioinformatics, cancer or mutations are also welcome to read the content of it. \
Any questions or feedback, please contact me at anhphuong.le@anu.edu.au 


The main document `main.tex`, which is linked to the contents in each chapters in the `chapters` folder. \
The `codes` folder is not directly incorporated in the document, but it was used to generate some of the graphics in the thesis.
