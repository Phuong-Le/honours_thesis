\chapter{Sequence Context Effect}\label{sce}

% Different cancers develop under the influence of different conditions, especially mutagens and repair systems, thus each cancer type possesses a distinctive mutation composition. Regarding individual mutation, each base change is closely integrated with the bases next to it \citep{Zhu2017,Zhu2020,Vinson2012CGMethylation}. The question is at which distance from the mutations do flanking bases still have an influence on whether the mutations occur. Using a measure of information richness, \gls{re}, this chapter demonstrates the importance of both the composition of base changes and their flanking bases in characterising the carcinogenesis pattern. This was done by splitting the sequence contexts into two separated analyses: spectrum analysis, which focuses only on the base change and neighbour analysis, which focuses only on the flanking bases. Above all, the chapter shows that the \gls{sce} is not just predominated by immediate flanking bases (\textit{i.e.} 3-mers). Rather, there is certain value in factoring larger sequence contexts into analysing cancer mutation composition.
