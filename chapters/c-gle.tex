\chapter{Genomic Location Effect}\label{gle}

The tendency for mutations to occur in closed \gls{chromatin} regions has been reported both in cancer and other mutagenesis processes \citep{Polak2015,Prendergast2007ChromatinGenome}. This is hypothetically because closed chromatin regions, despite being less exposed to mutagens, are harder for repair systems to reach \citep{Prendergast2007ChromatinGenome,Teng1997ExcisionSequences, Morse2002PhotoreactivationCerevisiae}. Based on the premise that different cell-types harbour different chromatin structures \citep{Kundaje2015IntegrativeEpigenomes}, it is reasonable to expect that when developed into tumours, mutations are allocated differently between different cell-types. This chapter shows further evidence, through a G-test of independence and the \gls{or} statistic, that in cancers, mutations do tend to occur in closed rather than open chromatin regions, with the exception of breast adenocarcinoma and rectal cell carcinoma. The degree at which this phenomenon occurs varies across cancer types. In addition, the chapter also uses the \gls{bootstrap} to confirm that \gls{gle} alone, without the chromatin status input, are significantly different in different cancers. 

\section{Mutation location is influenced by chromatin status}
My analyses of GLE were in accordance with the observation that mutations tend to locate in closed chromatin regions. Figure \ref{fig:mutation_density} shows the distribution of mutations on chromosome 12 for four cancers, the rest can be found in Figure \ref{fig:apdx_mutation_density} of the appendix. The green DHS bars near the bottom of the plots are hypersensitive regions, so chromatin is open at regions with dense DHS bars. The choice to display chromosome 12 was arbitrary. By visualisation alone, it can already be seen that mutation density tends to peak at regions with less dense DHS bars, indicating a bias towards closed chromatin regions. This pattern is particularly strong in Skin-Melanoma and Liver-HCC, and less obvious in Kidney-RCC. It is also worth noting that the chromatin structures are different for different cancers. Looking at the density by itself, we could see a diversity in how mutations are distributed, supporting the potential of GLE in discriminating cancers. Unsurprisingly, there are certain conserved patterns for the cancers, which hypothetically correspond to important characteristics of human cells. For example, the level of mutations tend to drop around position 5$\times 10^7$, at which chromatin is closed for all cell types.

\subsection{Open and closed chromatin regions have significantly different mutation rates}
Having visualised the tendency of mutation location, I performed a G-test of independence to see whether a formal hypothesis test can confirm that there is a difference in how mutations are distributed between open and closed chromatin regions. The p-values estimated from this were adjusted by Bonferroni multiple test correction and shown in Table \ref{tab:g-test}; the raw inputs can be found in Appendix \ref{apdx:g-test}. To begin with, the size of the regions identified as open chromatin is considerably tiny compared to that of closed chromatin regions. Keeping that in mind, we can see that most cancers had significantly different mutation rates between open and closed chromatin regions, except CNS-PiloAstro and Panc-Endocrine. Note that these two cancers had small to modest numbers of mutations. While no direct correlation between p-values and number of mutations could be detected, no cancers with less than 1 million mutations gave a p-value $>10^{-100}$. Our conclusion remains that mutation location is not random between open and closed chromatin regions, but this implies the impact of mutation load on the power of the test.

\subsection{Mutations are biased towards closed regions, with variation}
Complementary to the G-tests, which suggests that the difference in mutation location were statistically significance between closed and open chromatin regions, I computed the odds ratio ($OR$), which measures the direction of this difference. From equation \ref{eq:or}, $OR$ compares the ratios of mutated over non-mutated positions between closed and open regions. An $OR<1$ indicates a bias towards closed regions, and an $OR>1$ indicates a bias towards open region. For each cancer, I estimated the possible range of $OR$'s using jackknife. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:or_jackknifed}.

Overall, mutations preferred to locate in closed chromatin regions, especially for Skin-Melanoma ($OR=2$). However, this bias varies for different cancers. In addition, there are three other intriguing features. First, Breast-AdenoCa and Kidney-RCC had $OR<1$. Their p-values from the G-test showed a significant difference between closed and open regions, so this preference for open regions is less likely to come from noise. On the density plot (Figures \ref{fig:mutation_density} and \ref{fig:apdx_mutation_density}), mutations still peak at closed chromatin regions, but less clear than for example Skin-Melanoma. Second, the departure of the observed $OR$ from the mean pseudo-values in Lymph-BNHL and Lymph-CLL suggests some abnormality in these cases. This abnormality could be due to the large variance of GLE in donors with these cancers. However, it could also come from the uncertainty in identification of the original cells (B cells fro both cancers, discussed in \ref{}). Third, CNS-PiloAstro has a widest estimated range of $OR$. Again, this might be because its small number of mutations lowered the signal to noise ratio compared to other cancers, which is consistent with the G-test. Regarding reliability, empirically, $OR$ seems more robust to the number of mutations than G-test. Mathematically, it accounts for the unbalance in the size of open \textit{v.s.} closed chromatin regions. However, we need to be vigilant about the existence of this the unbalance.
