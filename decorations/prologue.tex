Through the journey of Honours, I was lucky enough to receive help and advice from many people. I also found that ideas are often generated and refined when I share them with other people. Now I understand more what it means by ``If you want to go far, go together''. With that, I would like to share this \LaTeX\ format, which took me quite some time to make, with anyone who wanted it - contact me at  . It was inspired by Andr√© Miede's \href{https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home}{\textit{A Classic Thesis Style}}, I think the code is a bit easier for beginners to tweak.
