Through the journey of Honours, I was lucky enough to receive help and advice from many people. I also found that ideas are often generated and refined when they are shared. With that, I would like to share the \LaTeX\ source code for this thesis template at \href{https://github.com/Phuong-Le/honours_thesis}{this GitHub repo}, which took me quite some time to make, with anyone who might want it. It was inspired by Andr√© Miede's \href{https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home}{\textit{A Classic Thesis Style}}, the code is not as fancy but a bit easier for beginners to tweak.
