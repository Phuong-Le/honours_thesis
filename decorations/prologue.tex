Through the journey of Honours, I was lucky enough to receive help and advice from many people. I also found that ideas are often generated and refined when they are shared. I understand more what it means by ``If you want to go far, go together''. With that, I would like to share this \LaTeX\ thesis template, which took me quite some time to make, with anyone who wanted it (contact me for the code). It was inspired by Andr√© Miede's \href{https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home}{\textit{A Classic Thesis Style}}, the code is less fancy but a bit easier for beginners to tweak.
